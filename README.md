### This program must be downloaded to work properly!

#### My Program
This is a guessing game program. You get the plot of the movie from IMDB top 100 list, and then you have to type in the title. the Title have to be perfect for the program to recognise it. but if all else fails you can see the title in the console. It gets the top 100 list from a separate .JSON file, found on github.

For my program, i have chosen to work with the "Movie API" from http://www.omdbapi.com. This API gives a lot of metadata for a big database of movies. Like director, Release, IMDB score and so on. Think of it as a IMDB database you can play with. 

#### This Mini_ex
This one has been one of the hardest ones yet. I have kept my use of APIs relativly simple. But learning a api is like learning the logic behind a new codeing language. It is hard when there are not a uniform ruleset for how to retrive specific data. i can se how that would be imposible with the diffrence between databases.
